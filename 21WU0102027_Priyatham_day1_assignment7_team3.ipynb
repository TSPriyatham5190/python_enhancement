Explain the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" in the context of inheritance.\n","\n","base class - this class get inherited by other classes, providing attiributes, functionalities\n","\n","derived class - inherits from base class, and can also override it with behaviour of base class\n","\n","\n","4. What is the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance? How does\n","it differ from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers?\n","\n","Public is Accessible anywhere.\n","\n","Protected is Accessible within the class, derived classes, and within the same package/module.\n","\n","Private is Accessible only within the class. Not inherited by derived classes.\n","\n","Significance of Protected is it allows controlled access for derived classes while keeping some encapsulation.\n","\n","\n","5. What is the purpose of the \"super\" keyword in inheritance? Provide an example.\n","\n","super is used in a derived class to call a constructor or method of the base class or parent class. It ensures the base class is initialized or its methods are reused."],"metadata":{"id":"mQWL3Un4AbTs"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vILE96NOAIOa"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6.
